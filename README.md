# MGS-Codec

A mini-project of recreating the MGS codec from the Metal Gear Solid series.

## To-Do

- Improve parsing of conversations, (i.e, some conversations still have the current speakers name intact like so 'Snake:'), I should make a list of all the occurances I find that should be parsed.
- Add different codecs for different games
- Figure out a way to determine the main character, as the main character will always be at the receiving end of the conversation. MGS2 for example has 2 main characters (Snake, Raiden) so I should see how I can determine this.
- Add image 'tv' effect to images
- Rework for horizontal views (mobile devices)
- Remove the Jenga '---' from Main.html
